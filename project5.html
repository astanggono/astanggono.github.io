							<h2>Research Questions:</h2>
							<p>The project will address several research questions to provide valuable insights and recommendations, including:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Are there regional variations in the rate of home health patients requiring urgent, unplanned care in the emergency room, and how does this relate to the quality of patient care provided?</li>
								<li>Does the provision of occupational therapy services by home health providers correlate with higher rates of patient improvement in activities of daily living?</li>
								<li>How does the frequency of assessing patients for depression differ between for-profit and non-profit home health providers, and what impact does this have on patient outcomes?</li>
								<li>What are the common services offered by home health care agencies, and how do they vary based on the type of ownership? How does the variation in services offered impact the overall quality of care?</li>
								<li>Is there a correlation between the age of home health care agencies and the quality of patient care they provide? How do the agency's years of certification contribute to this relationship?</li>
								<li>Do home health care agencies offering a comprehensive range of services tend to have higher quality ratings?</li>
							</ol>

							<p>By addressing these research questions and delivering a range of consulting services and actionable insights, the DSC Group aims to help ABC Health Insurance optimize its healthcare network and make informed decisions that benefit both the organization and its customers.</p>
