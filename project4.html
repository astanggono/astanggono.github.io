							<h1>Experimental Study - Effect of Pillow Type and Age Group on Sleep Quality</h1>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>
								This study conducted an experiment to explore the relationship between the type of pillow used and the quality of sleep, with implications for marketing strategies. Quality sleep is vital for overall well-being, making it essential to understand factors that influence it, such as pillow choice. The research questions examined the impact of pillow type and age group on sleep quality.
							</p>
						
							<h2>Methodology:</h2>
							<p>
								The study involved 400 participants aged 21-60, excluding those with pre-existing neck/back problems and insomnia. Gender balance was maintained in each age group. Participants were assigned different pillow types and monitored using Fitbit Charge 5 for two weeks.
							</p>
						
							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>
								The study found that the latex pillow significantly improved sleep quality compared to the standard feather pillow. Furthermore, participants aged 21-40 had lower sleep quality than those aged 41-60.
							</p>
												
							<h2>Statement of Problem</h2>
							<p>
								Sleep quality has significant implications for health and well-being. Understanding the influence of pillow type on sleep quality is crucial for promoting better sleep. The study was conducted on behalf of Mattress Firm to inform their marketing strategies regarding different pillow types and target demographics.
							</p>
							
							<h2>Research Questions, Hypotheses, and Effects:</h2>

							<h4>Research Question 1:</h4>
							<p> Does the latex pillow lead to higher mean sleep scores measured by Fitbit Charge 5 compared to the standard feather pillow?</p>
							<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The mean sleep score for the latex pillow is significantly higher than that for the standard feather pillow.</p>
							<p><strong>Effect Size:</strong> A difference of 5 in mean sleep score is considered meaningful.</p>

							<h4>Research Question 2:</h4>
							<p>Is the mean sleep score for the age group 21-40 lower than that for the age group 41-60?</p>
							<p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> The mean sleep score for the age group 21-40 is significantly lower than that for the age group 41-60.</p>
							<p><strong>Effect Size:</strong> A difference of 8 in mean sleep score is considered meaningful.</p>
